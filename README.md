We are starting to actively experiment with various software for a Cleanroom concept. To test and evaluate software we need machines. These will be prepared identically (as cows, not pets). This project helps us record what weâ€™re setting, why and the values we're using. As practical we will script the configurations so they're easier to reproduce.
